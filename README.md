## Running build script

You'll need node.js for it.

Run:

```bash
cd utils
node utils/build.js
```

the output is placed in the `build` folder.

(The old `build.py` file is in `utils` for ~~~historical~~~ nostalgical purposes, or until I delete it and ask you to look at earlier versions of the repo if you're interested).
